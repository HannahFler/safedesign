Jupyter notebooks from the project 'Safe and Sustainable by Design: Environmental Fate of Phosphorus Compounds' are shared here.

Notebook 1 contains the code for the in silico generation of structures, by passing systematically vaired chemical formulas to PMG for exhaustive structure generation. 

Notebook 2 contains code used to create the dataset of QSAR results for the generated structures.

Notebook 2a contains code used to test the applicability of the QSAR models used.

Notebook 3 contains the code for the MAUT assessment of the properties and the selection of the target molecule.


The Biowin1-7 estimation results for all 6.3 M generated structures are split up into three chunks and uploaded in the files biowin_per_smiles_63_1.zip, biowin_per_smiles_63_2.zip, and biowin_per_smiles_63_3.zip

The dataset of further QSAR results for all ready biodegradable structures used for the MAUT analysis (input to notebook 3) is called insilico_smiles_properties.txt.

The two molfiles organophosphate.sdf and phosphate.sdf were used as initial fragement input for PMG.
